# UI-for-Data-Acquisition-System---Vibration-Damping-System

The data acquisition system for vibration analysis interfaces the DAQ device with a computer via a USB connection. The data received at the computerâ€™s serial port is read by custom software developed using Python and PyQt5. This software provides a graphical user interface (GUI) to facilitate user interaction for starting, stopping, and saving the recorded vibration data.

## Detailed Explanation of UI

### 1. Initial Launch Screen
